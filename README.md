- If you die with no karma shield, the death is permanent like a Hunter death.
- If you quit 30 seconds into a cycle, your current karma and karma shield are erased.
- When this mod is enabled, you use a separate set of save files, so you can't accidentally lose a save file by leaving the mod on.

Enjoy hell.

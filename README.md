When this mod is enabled, you use a separate set of save files, so you can't accidentally lose a save file by leaving the mod on.

Here are the rules:
- If you die without karma flower protection, the death is permanent like a Hunter death.
- If you quit 30 seconds into a cycle:
	- If you have karma flower protection, it's removed. If not:
	- If your current karma is higher than zero, it's reset to zero. If not, you die permanently.

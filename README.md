- If you die with no karma reinforcement (from a karma flower), the death is permanent like a Hunter death.
- If you quit 30 seconds into a cycle:
	- If you have karma reinforcement, it's removed. If not,
	- If your karma is higher than 0, your current karma is reset. If not,
	- You die permanently.
- When this mod is enabled, you use a separate set of save files, so you can't accidentally lose a save file by leaving the mod on.

Enjoy hell.
